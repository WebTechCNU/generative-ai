# Generative AI and AR

## Plan 

1. Prompt Engineering 
- Techniques
- Summarizing 
- Transforming, extracting, ...

2. AI models overview
- chatbots
- text to video, video editing, music
- text to image
- customization

3. RAG system 
- vectorization, quering, etc. 
- custom rag system construction 

4. Generative AI
- key concepts
- generative models (Gaussian mixture, Auotoencoders etc.)

5. DL-based models 
- GAN (generative adv.)
- VAe

6. Generative ai for DS
- key tools and techniques

7. AR
- Unity (??)
- open cv python module
